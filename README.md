# Duck-Libs

During Spring 2019 I worked on a project with 1 Human Centered Design & Engineering student and 2
Interaction Design students to create an installation that aimed to bring together the Computer Science
community at the University of Washington for my CSE 441 Capstone Class. Over the course of 10 weeks, we worked together to
interview students and faculty, come up with an idea, and develop a final prototype of our installation to
showcase. I was the sole developer on the team and worked closely with both designers to create our
interface. The installation is called Duck-Libs and aims to bring together the Computer Science community
through duck-themed mad-libs. The [Final Documentation](final-documentation/Final-Documentation.pdf) goes into more detail about our process our what we learned.
## Purpose
The purpose of Duck-Libs is to provide a platform for the CSE undergraduate community to
reflect, share advice, and “de-bug” common challenges and experiences. It adds a personalized
community activity to the Gates Undergraduate Labs, and creates a more connected and inviting
environment. “Rubber Duck Debugging” is a way software engineers use to debug their code, they talk
through their code to a rubber duck in hopes that explaining their thinking out loud, a software engineer will
be able to notice what’s wrong with their code. In our installation, students may talk to a duck to debug
problems in their code, and now they can debug situations in their lives by reflecting on past and present
experiences. The platform resembles “Mad-Libs”, a guided fill-in-the-blank children’s story activity, and
utilizes ludic design to encourage playful reflection. When students approach the main podium they can
begin interacting with the Duck-Libs interface which walks them through a series of prompts, asking them
questions about their own life. Once they finish the prompts, they receive a personalized, printed story
about their life. The story has an encouraging tone, and highlights that although everyone has different
experiences, they are all still united as a Computer Science community and don’t have to “debug” life’s
challenges alone. Students can take the story with them, and it serves as a tangible artifact to remind
them of their journey and place in the community.
